      <p>Searching across ALL courts in England and Wales.</p>
      <p>You can conduct your search by entering the full surname, or if you are unsure of the spelling, just the first few characters of the surname.</p>
      <p>The forename is optional, but could significantly speed up your search if entered.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        If searching on a name containing non-alphabetic text such as an apostrophe (eg: O'DONALD), it is recommended that you just enter the first character of the surname and as much as possible of the forename.
