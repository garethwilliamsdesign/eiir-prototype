        <li>bankruptcies that are current or have ended in the last 3 months</li>
        <li>debt relief orders that are current or have ended in the last 3 months</li>
        <li>current individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) and Fast-Track voluntary arrangements (FTVAs), including those that have ended in the last 3 months</li>
        <li>current bankruptcy restrictions orders or undertakings (BROs/BRUs) and interim bankruptcy restrictions orders (iBROs)</li>
