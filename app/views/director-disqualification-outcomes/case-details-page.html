BALTIC HOUSE DEVELOPMENTS LTD (i) On 6 June 2016 Craig Griffiths (“Mr Griffiths”) signed a loan agreement between BHD and China Town Development Company Ltd (“CTD”) wherein BHD provided a loan facility to CTD in the sum of £1,500,000 and thereafter permitted BHD to make loans in the sum of £1,246,000 to CTD. (ii) During his tenure as director, he permitted BHD to make loans in the sum of £1,868,958.39 to North Point (Pall Mall) Ltd (“NPPM”). (iii) During his tenure as director, he permitted BHD to make payments in the sum of £1,166,072.79 to North Point Global Limited (“NPG”) which were recorded as loans but are now stated by NPG to have been treated as fees due to the recipient company. (iv) During his tenure as director, he permitted BHD to make loans in the sum of £177,821.00 to Vienna House Developments Limited. (v) These loans/payments were made using investor deposits, which was contrary to the marketing material produced for BHD which stated that investor deposits would be ring fenced for the acquisition and/or development of the site. (vi) He permitted BHD to pay to Blue Ray Enterprises FZE £86,969 more than had been certified as owing to that company. B. WARWICK ROAD DEVELOPMENTS LTD (i) On 19 February 2016 he signed a loan agreement allowing WRD to provide a loan facility of £1,000,000 to CTD and thereafter allowed WRD to make loans in the sum of £970,000. (ii) During his tenure as director, he permitted WRD to make loans: a. in the sum of £1,782,428.52 to NPPM; and b. in the sum of £95,000 to BHD. (iii) During his tenure as director, he permitted WRD to make payments to NPG which were recorded as loans but are now stated by NPG to have been treated as fees due to NPG in the sum of £785,745.01. (iv) These loans/payments were made using investor deposits and were made for purposes other than those for which the monies had been released by solicitors for WRD. (v) He made insufficient enquiries into certificates issued by INCA Management Limited which falsely certified that build costs totalling £1,751,719.80 had been incurred where in truth only £317,384.54 had been incurred.</textarea>
